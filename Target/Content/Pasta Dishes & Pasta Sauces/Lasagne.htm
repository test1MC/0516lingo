        <h2>Lasagne</h2>
        <p class="from">We have been wanting to make a traditional lasagne for a long time and convert it to vegetarian. We have held off for so long because Frank has fond memories of his Grandmother's lasagne, and didn't want to make one that wasn't traditional and wasn't good. After a lot of research we have finally found the time to try to make our version. The key was to try to make this dish and have it look and taste traditional. Serve it to some friends and family, but do not tell them it is vegetarian, they will never know. Enjoy. </p>

        <p><b>For the Sauce:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Heat a heavy-bottomed pot (at least 4 quarts) over medium-high heat, then add enough olive oil to cover the bottom. Add the garlic and sauté, shaking the pan for about one minute; then add the diced onions. Lower the heat to medium and sauté the onions for 3-4 minutes until they wilt and become translucent.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Add the sausage meat, and sauté, breaking up chunks with a wooden spoon or the back of a fork as they go in. Add the ground beef, breaking it up as well. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the meats lose their color and begin to brown.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>While the meats are cooking, put the tomato paste into a bowl, rinse out the can with wine and add it to the bowl. Stir gently with a fork to dissolve the tomato paste, then add an additional can of wine (This is how my grandmother measured, but it comes to 12 oz., a cup and a half.) Stir the mixture into the meats, raise the heat to high and boil for a minute or two, evaporating the alcohol.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Lower the heat to medium, add the canned tomatoes and bring the pot to a simmer. Adjust the heat so the sauce bubbles gently. Add the oregano and half the basil; partially cover the pan so that the sauce gives up some of its liquid. Simmer gently for about one and one half hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>For the filling:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Beat the egg in a bowl, then stir in the ricotta. Stir in the Parmesan, the remaining basil, parsley, and nutmeg. Set the mixture aside.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>Assembly:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350° F.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Using an oven-proof casserole approximately 9 x 13 inches with 2-inch sides, ladle a cup of sauce over the bottom and spread evenly. Place three or four sheets of lasagne over the sauce, then follow with a ladle or two of sauce. Now gently spread approximately 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the ricotta mixture over the meat sauce layer. Atop the ricotta, place 10 slices of hard-boiled egg (roughly defining each portion). Follow with a sprinkling of Parmesan and a sprinkling of mozzarella.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Repeat this sequence until you’ve filled the pan within 3/4 inch of the top. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>pasta</li>
            <li>sauce</li>
            <li>ricotta </li>
            <li>hard boiled egg</li>
            <li>grated cheeses </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Add a final layer of pasta and top with a thin layer of sauce. <b>Note:</b> You may not use all the pasta  and may have leftover sauce.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>We recommend that the pan be sealed with aluminum foil and baked, in the middle of the oven, for at least 50 minutes. Then, test the texture of the cooked pasta (as you would a cake) with a straw or knife blade. When it’s cooked to your satisfaction, sprinkle on the last layer of mozzarella and place the uncovered pan back in the oven. </p>
        <p><b>TIP:</b> Placing a baking sheet on the rack below the uncovered pan will catch any drips.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Bake just long enough to melt the cheese and/or brown the top of the lasagne. Remove from the oven and let it sit at least 10 minutes before serving. Garnish each portion with parsley.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Suggestions.flsnp" />
        <p> You can add chopped black olives to the layers or just the top (I do not prefer this but know people who enjoy it this way).</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Information.flsnp" />
        <p>Lasagne is the correct spelling of this dish. It is the plural of lasagna, a wide, flat noodle.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Lasagne is about the ingredients, use freshly grated cheeses and fresh herbs if you can. It will make a difference. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Serves 10 as the pasta course in a feast or 6-8 as a substantial main dish.</p>
