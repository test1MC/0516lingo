        <h2>Black Bean Chili</h2>
        <p class="from">Recipe courtesy of  Karla Palmer, 2013</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Ingredients.flsnp" />
        <p>1 pound dried black beans (2 1/2 cups), rinsed</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>¼ cup mustard seeds</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons New Mexican chili powder</p>
        <p>1½ teaspoons cumin seeds, or ground cumin</p>
        <p>½ teaspoon cardamom seeds, or ground cardamom</p>
        <p>2 medium onions, coarsely chopped</p>
        <p> 2-3 Cups dried oyster mushrooms, chopped </p>
        <p>8 ounces tomatillos, husked, rinsed and coarsely chopped</p>
        <p>¼ cup water</p>
        <p>5½ cups vegetable or mushroom broth </p>
        <p>1 6-ounce can tomato paste</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons minced canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</p>
        <p>1¼ cups grated Monterey Jack, or pepper Jack cheese</p>
        <p>½ cup reduced-fat sour cream</p>
        <p>½ cup fresh cilantro, chopped</p>
        <p>2  limes, cut into wedges</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <p>1.	Soak beans overnight in 2 quarts water. (Alternatively, place beans and 2 quarts water in a large pot. Bring to a boil. Boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for 1 hour). Drain the beans, discarding soaking liquid.</p>
        <p>2.	Combine oil, mustard seeds, chili powder, cumin and cardamom in a 5- to 6-quart Dutch oven. Place over high heat and stir until the spices sizzle, about 30 seconds. Add onions, mushrooms (ONLY IF USING FRESH – ADD DRIED MUSHROOMS IN STEP 3), tomatillos and water. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are juicy, 5 to 7 minutes. Uncover and stir often until the juices evaporate and the vegetables are lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Add broth, tomato paste and chipotles; mix well.</p>
        <p>3.	Place the beans in a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker. Pour the hot vegetable mixture over the beans. Turn heat to high. Put the lid on and cook until the beans are creamy, 5 to 8 hours. (NOTE: I USED THE STOVETOP OPTION – SEE BELOW).</p>
        <p>4.	Garnish each serving with cheese, a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>Stovetop Variation: Total: 4 1/2 hours In Step 2, increase broth to 81/2 cups. Omit Step 3. Add the beans to the Dutch oven; cover and simmer the chili gently over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the beans are creamy to bite, about 3 hours.  PS - I DIDN'T USE A DUTCH OVEN, JUST A LARGE HEAVY SOUP POT.</b>
