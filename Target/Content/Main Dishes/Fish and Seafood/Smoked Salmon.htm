        <h2>Smoked Salmon</h2>
        <p class="from">Recipe courtesy of  Darren Kessler (from Mitchel), 2017</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Ingredients.flsnp" />
        <p>3 lb salmon filet, no skin</p>
        <p>2 Cups Dark Brown Sugar</p>
        <p>½ cup Kosher Salt</p>
        <p>1-2 tbls fresh ground pepper</p>
        <p>4-5 rough chopped garlic cloves</p>
        <p>1 jar of Apricot jam or honey.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Cure</p>
        <p>2 Cups Dark Brown Sugar</p>
        <p>½ cup Mortons Kosher Salt</p>
        <p>1-2 tbls fresh ground pepper</p>
        <p>4-5 rough chopped garlic cloves</p>
        <p>Mix together the cure ingredients in a bowl.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p>Cut salmon into roughly 2 inch wide portions.</p>
        <p>Put down a layer of cure into a glass or plastic dish (not metal).</p>
        <p>Layer in salmon portions and cover with more cure.</p>
        <p>Add second layer of salmon portions as needed and cover with cure.</p>
        <p>Cover salmon with a layer of saran wrap tightly to seal out some air. Cover the glass dish with another piece of saran wrap.</p>
        <p>Place in the refrigerator over night (at least 8 hours. 24 is better.)</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Drying</p>
        <p>After curing in the refer overnight remove from fridge and rinse thoroughly each piece with cold water. Lay the rinsed pieces onto a greased or sprayed or olive oiled rack. Pat dry each portion with a paper towel.</p>
        <p>Allow the salmon portions to sit on the rack for a couple of hours. Inside in the house is fine. Some people even say to blow a fan on them during this time. You want the pieces to develop a skin coating. Should be shiny after a couple of hours.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Smoking</p>
        <p>Place the rack of salmon portions on the smoker. I try to keep the smoker around 210-225. Smoke for about an hour and a quarter. At that point brush on melted apricot jam or honey and smoke for another 30 minutes.</p>
