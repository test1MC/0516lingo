        <p>1½ teaspoons salt</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper</p>
        <p>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon garlic powder</p>
        <p>4 cups weak <MadCap:keyword term="vegetarian chicken stock" />vegetarian chicken stock (better than bullion) - make it weak (maybe one tsp)</p>
        <p>2 cups water</p>
        <p>2-3 dried <MadCap:keyword term="ancho chiles" />ancho chiles</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">1 oz. package of dried <MadCap:keyword term="shiitake mushrooms" />shiitake mushrooms (halved and sliced)</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>3 bay leaves</p>
        <p> </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p>Put dried black-eyed peas in a large pot and cover with about 4 inches of water. Soak the peas overnight, then drain the water and rinse the peas.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Cook the bacon strips and set aside on a paper towel to soak up any excess oil. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the onion and garlic and cook until lightly browned, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add the salt, black pepper, cayenne and garlic powder and chopped up 'bacon'. Cook until the entire mixture is coated with the spices, about 2 minutes. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Pour in the stock and water into a crock pot and drop in the bay leaves and ancho chili. Set on auto and cook covered, for about a few hours, until the peas are soft.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Suggestions.flsnp" />
        <p> Using the back of a spoon, smash some of the peas against the inside of the pot then stir them into the mixture. This will break up some of the peas and give them a creamier consistency.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Serve over rice.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Taste for seasonings, and add some hot-pepper vinegar, if desired. Discard the bay leaves and transfer the black-eyed peas to a serving bowl.</p>
