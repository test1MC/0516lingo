        <p>Grill the peppers and tomatoes until the skins are slightly charred and easy to peel off. Let cool for 10 minutes so that they are not too hot to handle. Peel the tomatoes and coarsely chop, reserving the liquid. Peel, stem and seed the peppers then coarsely chop, reserving any liquid.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Cook onion, garlic, chiles, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in 2 tablespoons oil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened and pale golden, about 8 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices, bell peppers, broth, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and simmer, covered, until peppers are tender, about 5 minutes.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Purée the soup using a submersion blender or  in 2 or 3 batches in a regular blender (use caution when blending hot liquids), drizzling remaining 1/4 cup oil while blending. Quick-chill soup in a metal bowl set in an ice bath, stirring often, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt as needed.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Serve and garnish with cheese crisps and cilantro.</p>
