        <p>RAMEN
</p>
        <p>1 Tbsp (15 ml) grape seed oil
</p>
        <p>5 cloves garlic (2 1/2 Tbsp | 18 g), roughly chopped
</p>
        <p>1 3-inch piece ginger, peeled and diced
</p>
        <p>1 medium yellow onion (110 g), coarsely chopped
</p>
        <p>6 cups (1440 ml) vegetable stock
</p>
        <p>2 Tbsp (30 ml) tamari or soy sauce, plus more to taste
</p>
        <p>0.5 + ounces (14 g) dehydrated shiitake mushrooms
</p>
        <p>1 Tbsp white or yellow miso paste </p>
        <p>1 tsp sesame oil (for flavor), plus more to taste
</p>
        <p>8 ounces (227 g) ramen noodles</p>
        <p>1/2 cup chopped green onion, for garnish</p>
        <p> </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large pot over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once hot, add oil, garlic, ginger and onion. Sauté, stirring occasionally for 5-8 minutes, or until the onion has developed a slight sear (browned edges).
</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup (240 ml) of the vegetable broth to deglaze the bottom of the pan. Use a whisk (or wooden spoon) to scrape up any bits that may have stuck to the bottom to enhance the flavor of the broth.
</li>
            <li>Add remaining 5 cups (1200 ml) vegetable broth, tamari or soy sauce, and dehydrated mushrooms - stir.
</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer on low for at least 1 hour, up to 2-3, stirring occasionally. The longer it cooks, the more the flavor will deepen and develop.
</li>
            <li>Taste broth and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more soy sauce or sesame oil if desired. Add the 1 Tbsp miso paste at this time.
</li>
            <li>When you’re 30 minutes from serving, prepare any desired toppings (see notes for miso-glazed carrots, baby bok choy, and quick-seared tofu).
</li>
            <li>NOODLES: Fill a large saucepan or pot with water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add ramen noodles (depending on size of pan you may need to do this in two batches) and cook according to package instructions - about 4-5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
</li>
            <li>Strain broth and reserve mushrooms for serving. (Save onions and ginger for serving as well, if desired, though I discarded them).
</li>
            <li>To serve, divide ramen noodles between four serving bowls. Top with strained broth and desired toppings, such as carrots, bok choy, green onion, or seared tofu. Serve with chili garlic sauce (found here) for added heat.
</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Optional
Toppings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Soft Boiled Egg (Boil water add eggs and boil for 5 minutes. Ice bath and peel carefully)</li>
            <li>10 ounces extra firm tofu, flash “fried”*
</li>
            <li>Miso or Huli-huli glazed carrots</li>
            <li>Miso or Huli-huli glazed baby bok choy</li>
            <li>Shushito peppers (Sauteed with oil)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> </p>

        <p>Best when fresh, though the broth can be stored (separately) in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, and in the freezer for up to 1 month.
