        <h2>Arugula &amp; Beet Salad</h2>
        <p class="from">This recipe was created from a taco and salad truck from a street fair in Hillcrest. It was deconstructed while we were standing with a few friends in a parking lot of a self wash car wash watching a band play. Yeah, we have a bunch of 'foodie' friends, so what...</p>
