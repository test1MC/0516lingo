        <h2>Roy's Chocolate Soufflé (Molten Lava Cake)</h2>
        <p class="from">Recipe courtesy of Roy Yamaguchi of Roy's</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Ingredients.flsnp" />
        <p>4 squares of parchment paper (3x3 inches)</p>
        <p>4 strips of parchment paper (2x12 inches)</p>
        <p>4 metal soufflé ring molds (3 inches in diameter x 2 inches tall) or parchment lined ramekins (see Note)</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Soufflé Batter:</p>
        <p>8 oz. good quality semi-sweet dark chocolate (i.e. Guittard, Vahlrona, Callebeaut - I used a Ghirardelli baking bar)</p>
        <p>12 Tablespoons butter</p>
        <p>1 cup granulated sugar</p>
        <p>3 Tablespoons cornstarch</p>
        <p>4 whole eggs plus 4 egg yolks</p>
        <p> </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p>To make the soufflé batter, combine sugar and cornstarch in a mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs and yolks. Bring butter to a simmer in a saucepan. Add chocolate and mix until smooth. Continue to mix until chocolate begins to simmer along the edges. Transfer the chocolate mixture to the dry ingredients. Mix until combined. Add eggs and mix at low speed until mixture is smooth and sugar dissolved. Pour into a bowl and refrigerate overnight.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 400°. Line each soufflé ring with a strip of parchment paper and spray with pan release such as Pam. Place parchment paper squares on a baking sheet and set molds on top.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Fill each ring mold or ramekin with soufflé batter ¾ of the way full. Bake on top oven rack for 26-28 minutes. My ramekins were a little smaller so I baked them for 21-23 minutes. You just want to make sure the tops are set but the middle is still gooey. Remove baking sheet from oven. Slide a metal spatula under each mold, and carefully transfer to individual serving plates using a pair of tongs. Gently lift off the mold and remove the parchment paper. If using ramekins, use a knife to and run it around the edge then carefully invert and place on a serving dish. Sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired. Serve immediately. Left over batter can be refrigerated for up to 10 days.</p>

        <p>If you don't have a souffle ring you can use ramekins. Line the bottom of each ramekin with a circle of parchment paper and line the sides with parchment paper as shown above. Spray with cooking spray. You can also just eat them straight out of the ramekins or use cupcake liners with reduced cooking time because they will be smaller. Another option is to bake them in a greased muffin tin with reduced cooking time.</p>
